    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Greetings, my name is Taylor, and I'm thrilled to have you here!

        Music and visual arts are my lifelong passions. As a neuro-divergent artist, I've taken a unique path, holding an English degree with a Math minor and working as a computer engineer to fund my art.
        
        I rekindled my love for music in 2019 as an excuse to sing, but it didn't become serious until 2020, during the global pandemic,  when I started taking classical and jazz guitar lessons again. I've fallen in love with the nylon string guitar and enjoy blending it into various music genres.
        
        I'm a one-person show – composer, producer, musician, vocalist, designer, and marketer. Most of my music compositionally starts with a musical score drafted within MuseScore before I record the material in my bedroom studio PVC blanket booth with the microphone I soldered together from a parts kit. 
        
        My music spans diverse styles, so there's something for everyone. Thanks for giving my independent music a listen. I'm deeply grateful for your support!

        Inspired by artists like Soen, TOOL, Opeth, Pink Floyd, The White Buffalo, and Witchcraft
